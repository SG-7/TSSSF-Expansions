# TSSSF-Expansions
A collection of expansions I have made for the Twilight Sparkle's Secret Shipfic Folder card game.

## Murf n' Nyan Productions - Finished
A pack of nine cards based on my friends and I. I made these back when I was still in college and only recently updated them. I also asked my friends what power they wanted on their cards, so if they seem a bit over powered, that's why.
### Card List
Pony - Blue Button,
Pony - Chaos Beat,
Pony - Checker Shade,
Pony - Flash Reel,
Pony - Lavendar Spell,
Ship - Magical Shockwave,
Ship - You've Been Justice'd,
Goal - Lover's Lightning,
Goal - Murf n' Nyan Productions

## Murf n' Nyan Expansion 2 - Soon...
Not sure if this will end up being completed. There are a few ideas that have been written down, but we'll see. Looking at it again, it seems that this expansion is almost complete. I'll take another look later and maybe finish the text portion of the cards before working on the art for Disciples of Equality.

## Fallout Equestria: Disciples of Equality - WIP
A pack of nine (or more) cards based on a story I was going to write in the Fallout Equestria universe. The Disciples of Equality follow the teachings of Starlight Glimmer (pre-redemption) and treat everyone as equals. However, her daughter may be able to end the fighting in the wasteland once and for all.
